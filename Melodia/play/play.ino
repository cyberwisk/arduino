/* Play Melody
 * -----------
 *
 * Program to play a simple melody
 *
 * Tones are created by quickly pulsing a speaker on and off 
 *   using PWM, to create signature frequencies.
 *
 * Each note has a frequency, created by varying the period of 
 *  vibration, measured in microseconds. We'll use pulse-width
 *  modulation (PWM) to create that vibration.

 * We calculate the pulse-width to be half the period; we pulse 
 *  the speaker HIGH for 'pulse-width' microseconds, then LOW 
 *  for 'pulse-width' microseconds.
 *  This pulsing creates a vibration of the desired frequency.

// MELODY and TIMING  =======================================

//  which sets each note's relative length (higher #, longer note)

/*
 * NOTES
 * The program purports to hold a tone for 'duration' microseconds.
 *  Lies lies lies! It holds for at least 'duration' microseconds, _plus_
 *  any overhead created by incremeting elapsed_time (could be in excess of 
 *  3K microseconds) _plus_ overhead of looping and two digitalWrites()
 *  
 * As a result, a tone of 'duration' plays much more slowly than a rest
 *  of 'duration.' rest_count creates a loop variable to bring 'rest' beats 
 *  in line with 'tone' beats of the same length. 
 * 
 * rest_count will be affected by chip architecture and speed, as well as 
 *  overhead from any program mods. Past behavior is no guarantee of future 
 *  performance. Your mileage may vary. Light fuse and get away.
 *  
 * This could use a number of enhancements:
 * ADD code to let the programmer specify how many times the melody should
 *     loop before stopping
 * ADD another octave
 * MOVE tempo, pause, and rest_count to #define statements
 * RE-WRITE to include volume, using analogWrite, as with the second program at
 *          http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PlayMelody
 * ADD code to make the tempo settable by pot or other input device
 * ADD code to take tempo or volume settable by serial communication 
 *          (Requires 0005 or higher.)
 * ADD code to create a tone offset (higer or lower) through pot etc
 * REPLACE random melody with opening bars to 'Smoke on the Water'
